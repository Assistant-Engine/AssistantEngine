1. Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this
   list of conditions, and the following disclaimer.

2. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,
   this list of conditions, and the following disclaimer in the documentation
   and/or other materials provided with the distribution.

3. Neither the name of the copyright holder nor the names of its
   contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from
   this software without specific prior written permission.

4. Branding & Attribution.
   (a) You may not remove, obscure, recolor, replace, or otherwise diminish any
       “Assistant Engine” branding (including name, logo, wordmarks, or default
       UI credits) in any deployment or distribution, except as expressly
       permitted by Clause 5 or an Enterprise License.
   (b) Community Edition deployments must retain a visible “About/Attribution”
       reference such as: “Powered by Assistant Engine — assistantengine.ai”.

5. Small-Team Allowance (Branding Adjustments).
   Internal deployments with no more than fifty (50) Active Users in any rolling
   thirty (30) day period may request minimal branding adjustments for internal
   use, provided that clear attribution remains visible and branding is not
   removed or replaced. This allowance does not authorize white-labeling or
   redistribution.

6. Scale Threshold (Enterprise Required).
   If a deployment serves more than fifty (50) Active Users in any rolling
   thirty (30) day period within an Organization, you must obtain an Enterprise
   License from Assistant Engine Ltd, whether or not branding is retained.

7. Redistribution, Hosting, and White-Label.
   Any redistribution to third parties—including hosted/SaaS, OEM, managed
   service/portal, or packaged resale models—or any removal/replacement of
   branding in connection with such redistribution, requires an Enterprise
   License.

8. No Misrepresentation.
   You must not state or imply that your deployment, distribution, or fork is
   sponsored by, endorsed by, or affiliated with Assistant Engine Ltd without
   specific prior written permission. Public forks must include a conspicuous
   disclosure in the About screen and README stating:
   “This is a customized fork of Assistant Engine (assistantengine.ai) and is
   not affiliated with or endorsed by Assistant Engine Ltd.”

9. Definitions.
   “Active User” means a unique authenticated natural person who accesses the
   user interface at least once during a rolling thirty (30) day window;
   includes employees, contractors, and managed/guest accounts. Shared logins
   count as the number of distinct individuals using them. Service/automation
   accounts are excluded.
   “Organization” means the deploying legal entity and any parent, subsidiary,
   or affiliate under common control; Active Users are aggregated across them.
   “Internal Deployment” means use within one Organization and not marketed or
   provided to third parties.
   “Redistribution” has the meaning in Clause 7 and includes hosted/SaaS,
   OEM, managed service/portal, or packaged resale.

10. Contributor Terms.
    By contributing, you represent you have the right to do so under these
    terms. Assistant Engine Ltd may request a contributor license agreement
    (CLA) for substantial changes to maintain licensing clarity.

11. Trademarks.
    “Assistant Engine” names and logos are unregistered trademarks of Assistant
    Engine Ltd. No rights to use our trademarks are granted by this License
    beyond the attribution/branding requirements above, and you must not seek
    to register confusingly similar marks.

12. Governing Law.
    This License is governed by the laws of England & Wales, and the courts of
    England & Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising out
    of or in connection with it.
